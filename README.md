# Digital-Signal-and-Image-Management
In this repository I collect projects developed in the academic setting for the Digital Signal and Image Management course of the master's degree in Data Science.

## Assignments:
1. Implementation of the Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR) function to describe a single channel audio signal.
2. Experimentation of the compression of a color image by blurring the channels of the YCbCr representation.
3. Implementation of a script for stitching images of two images.
4. Implementation of an image classification neural network.
5. Implementation of a classification script based on the development of a neural network.

## Project:
This project consists in developing a series of Deep Learning models aimed at addressing the problem of emotion recognition starting from audio files (Speech-Emotion-Rec) and facial images (Face-Emotion-Rec).
